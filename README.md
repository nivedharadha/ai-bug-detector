* **Smart Editor**: A robust code input area supporting multiple languages (currently showing Java support).
* **Analysis Results**: Real-time bug detection powered by `gemma-3-12b-it`. It flags specific lines with warnings, such as unreachable code or infinite loops.
* **Simple Explanation**: A human-friendly breakdown of *why* the bug exists, powered by `gemma-3-4b-it`. It turns complex compiler warnings into understandable logic.
* **Optimized Code**: Instant generation of corrected, clean code using `gemma-3-12b-it`, ready to be copied back into your project.

## 🧠 The AI Engine

BugLens uses a tiered model approach through **OpenRouter** to balance speed and reasoning depth:

| Section | Model Used | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis** | `google/gemma-3-12b-it:free` | High-reasoning detection of logical flaws. |
| **Explanation** | `google/gemma-3-4b-it:free` | Lightweight, fast natural language processing. |
| **Optimization** | `google/gemma-3-12b-it:free` | Complex code synthesis and refactoring. |
